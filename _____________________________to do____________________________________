balancing mechanism 
    + instead of averaging the similarities find a safe interval
    ++ two types of calculation method is implemented
        average
        0.75 quartile

implement batched version
    + adding batch_size of item in each iteration, -1 means all, positive integers are batch sizes
   
iterative process to check improvement
    only for the affected labels, the labels that are found during the oversampling
    maybe AL can be included
    similarity factor
        each time change threshold with a logic like simulated annealing
        threshold can be tuned with with the results of the iterative classifier
    
try different similarity metrics

find the most effective embedding method

define a stopping condition
- now num of req instances to balance a class is calculated and split into batches but a batch is added if it improves the f1, it may not add instance
- it should be like, I searched all the data and stop if no improvement, or iteration

similairty-distance relation 
    -from Applied multivariate statistical analysis
        s = 1/(1+d)
        d = (2*(1-s))^0.5
    -s = 1 / d
    -s = 1 / (d+1)
    -s = 1 / e^d 
    -normed
        a. find norm: d_norm = distance / max(distance)
        b. similarity = 1 - d_norm


notes:
-during oversampling we calculate class similarities only with labeled set and we use it in each iteration during oversampling
recalculating it in each iteration after new instances are added may help!



Parameters
