implement batched version
    one at a time
    mini-batch version
    each time change threshold with a logic like simulated annealing
    threshold can be tuned with with the results of the iterative classifier
    
iterative process to check improvement
    only for the affected labels, the labels that are found during the oversampling
    maybe AL can be included
    
try different similarity metrics

find the most effective embedding method

balancing mechanism 
	instead of averaging the similarities find a safe interval
	the ones that have low similarity badly affect the average, ex: find the q3 and q4 and take their average
